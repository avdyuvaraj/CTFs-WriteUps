ThunderCipher – A02-Misconfig Writeup

Difficulty: Easy
Category: Web Exploitation
Vulnerability: OWASP A02 – Security Misconfiguration
Target IP: 192.168.5.84
Port: 80

Challenge Description

Welcome to A02-Misconfig, a web application affected by Security Misconfiguration vulnerabilities.

The application appears to be a normal production-ready platform. The login works. The dashboard loads. Everything seems secure… or does it?

The objective of this challenge was to enumerate the application and identify security misconfigurations leading to sensitive information disclosure and privilege escalation.

Methodology

Port Scanning

Service Enumeration

Directory Brute Forcing

Sensitive File Analysis

Source Code Inspection

Credential Exploitation

Admin Panel Access

Phase 1 – Port Scanning
Tool Used

Nmap

Command Used
nmap 192.168.5.84 -sV -A
Explanation

-sV → Service version detection

-A → OS detection, script scanning, traceroute

Results

Open Ports:

• 22/tcp – SSH
• 80/tcp – HTTP (Apache 2.4.66 Debian)

Port 80 was identified as the primary attack surface.

Phase 2 – Directory Enumeration
Tool Used

Gobuster

Command Used
gobuster dir -u http://192.168.5.84 \
-w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt \
-x php,txt,zip,bak,env
Explanation

dir → Directory mode

-u → Target URL

-w → Wordlist

-x → File extension brute-forcing

Extensions searched:
php, txt, zip, bak, env

Discovered Endpoints

• /login.php
• /register.php
• /.env
• /backups
• /config.php

Critical findings:

• /.env
• /backups

Phase 3 – Exposed Environment File

Accessed:

http://192.168.5.84/.env

The environment file was publicly accessible.

Sensitive information exposed:

• SECRET_KEY
• DB_PASSWORD
• ADMIN_EMAIL
• FLAG

Flag 1

Phase 4 – Backup File Exposure

Accessed:

http://192.168.5.84/backups/

Backup files were publicly accessible.

Sensitive internal data was retrieved.

Flag 2

Phase 5 – Source Code Inspection

Viewed page source of the application.

Discovered HTML comment containing admin credentials:

<!--Admin Password remove after deploying on production:
Very_Strong_p@ssw0rd_k33p_pr1v4t3-->

This indicates poor deployment practices.

Phase 6 – Admin Login

Accessed:

http://192.168.5.84/login.php

Credentials used:

Username: admin
Password: Very_Strong_p@ssw0rd_k33p_pr1v4t3

Login successful.

Admin panel revealed final flag.

Final Flag

Vulnerability Analysis
Vulnerability Type

OWASP Top 10 – A02: Security Misconfiguration

Issues Identified

• Publicly accessible .env file
• Exposed backup directory
• Hardcoded credentials in HTML comments
• Sensitive data exposed in production

Impact

• Credential disclosure
• Database compromise
• Privilege escalation
• Full administrative takeover

In real-world applications, this could lead to:

• Data breach
• System compromise
• Reputation damage

Remediation

Block access to sensitive files via web server configuration

Store .env files outside web root

Remove backup files from public directories

Remove debug information before deployment

Conduct configuration audits before production
